;; squint_stage.clj — stage the squint gate's source roots into a

;;
;;   bb scripts/squint_stage.clj <stage-dir> <root> [<root> ...]
;;
;; The four rules, each measured against 0.16.213 (see
;; adapters/types/squint and adapters/coll/squint for the runtime
;; halves of R2/R3's story):
;;
;;  R1 poison heads. A namespace that both :refer-clojure :excludes a
;;     core name and :refers Eve's macro of that name (deftype,
;;     locking, defdelay, caching-hash, ...) gets NO macro resolution
;;     for that head from squint: its core-macro-shadowed? check
;;     consults the exclude set but not the refers, the form degrades
;;     to a runtime funcall, and a deftype's method specs are then
;;     read by squint's built-in assoc-inline as key/value pairs —
;;     'assoc expects a collection followed by key/value pairs' at
;;     best, silent miscompilation at worst. Qualify every call head
;;     in the poison set to its home namespace (eve.deftype/deftype),
;;     which resolves regardless of the excludes.
;;
;;  R2 core gaps. Bare heads naming cljs.core fns squint core does
;;     not export (unchecked-byte, gensym, lazy-cat, make-array,
;;     array-seq, read-string) compile to free variables and the
;;     module dies at load (hamt-util's unchecked-byte was the first
;;     measured). Route the heads to eve.core's — adapters/coll/squint
;;     defines each name on both faces — and require eve.core in the
;;     staged ns when a gap head fired and it is not already
;;     required. Names the file itself defines or refers are left.
;;
;;  R3 empty-list values in type forms. A () value inside a
;;     deftype-family form compiles in squint's deftype emit to a
;;     call `null()` (rseq's -empty, rrbt's -chunked-rest, sorted's
;;     hasheq). Plain defn bodies compile () correctly; the type
;;     forms' bodies go through the machinery's emit, where the
;;     empty list is read as a call with no head. Rewrite unquoted
;;     () to (list) inside those forms (quote-tracked).
;;
;;  R4 same-file macros. A macro defined and called in the same
;;     file (eve.alpha's and eve.thread's api-defs) never expands —
;;     squint takes a file's own macros only through :require-macros,
;;     the .cljc self-require pattern. Insert the self
;;     :require-macros clause naming the called macros.
;;
;;  R5 test-lib :refer-macros. Squint expands clojure.test/cljs.test
;;     macros referred via :refer or an :as alias, but a
;;     :refer-macros spec is dropped: (deftest ...) compiles to a
;;     bare call to a var that does not exist. Eve's test files use
;;     [cljs.test :refer-macros [deftest testing is]] pervasively.
;;     Rewrite the spec's :refer-macros key to :refer in the staged
;;     ns form (reader conditionals in the ns form are resolved to
;;     squint's branch — :squint, else :cljs, else :default, in
;;     source order — so the spec is visible to the rewrite).
